- Teams can consist of between 1 and 4 people.
- The projects submitted for judging cannot have been started prior to the start of the hackathon. In other words, teams can plan their projects in great detail, but they cannot begin writing code until they arrive at the hackathon.

- Any and all resources used must be open source and specified in either the project, or the project description.

- Projects can not have been submitted to another event, including other hackathons this weekend.
