- Motivation: When searching up Parental controls, there is a lack of Youtube filters past the age of 13 to 17. Youtube does enforce pre-teen controls for their children however, a person's definition of safety compared to others may vary at a different degree. In addition to this, we've noticed that youtube comments tend to be weaker in terms of translation curses. In this case, we've originally prepared a translator which would scan for curse words in different languages.
