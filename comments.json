If there\u2019s a need or solves a problem people have, or if it helps a person go from their current state and help them achieve their dream state of some kind, or makes their life easier (convenience), then chances are, your service will work. Also nothing is done solo. You\u2019ll do the programming, UX/UI design, QA testing, marketing, negotiating with investors and future buyers, and be responsible with everything. You will easily get burnt out doing it so it\u2019s best to delegate and divide the responsibilities as you can, which is where your outreaching skills happen. That\u2019s why a lot of those tech startups end up succeeding. You needa hold 20 different positions when doing this. Many have tried, only few succeeded and you need to be OBSESSED with your craft to truly be successful in it. Most will choose the software engineering route and work for some tech company making 150k a year with insane growth benefits, but very few are bold and crazy enough to try and go all or nothing. Many fail trying to achieve this dream. It\u2019s not for everyone. Those that are bold, I\u2019m rooting for you. The sky is the limit.",

I have worked in other people&#39;s start ups, in big companies, my own start up, freelance and even in a government agency.  Meaning, I have about seen it all.  <br>First and foremost most of what is presented on youtube about working in software is wrong, and intentionally misleading.  <br>Where I made the most money was either in a big company or in a government agency.  It is also where I did the least amount of programming.  In the start up&#39;s of other people is where I did the most amount of programming and very long hours, and made much less money, but ironically had &quot;more fun&quot;(..sort of...) because I was actually programming systems that were &quot;revolutionary&quot; in a sense that they had not been done before. <br>Working freelance was by far the worse job.  Those contracting have unrealistic expectations, and want to pay almost nothing.  I would highly recommend staying away from freelance work, unless you are homeless and starving, and even then you will probably make more money per hour as a dishwasher.<br>Where my views on software development really changed completely is when I had my own start up company.  That was like being in a rollercoaster and in a washing machine all at the same time. I got a small team together and we started a company, and I had 2 investors to finance it. Before finishing the project, our investors found us more investors, but these investors want to buy out everything, which would make quick money for the original investors, but turn me into a simple employee with some shares(not an owner of the company). I turned the offer down.  The project dragged on, and took about 5 years to finish.  After about the first 2 years I had already lost about 80% of the original team, and after 3 years I was the only person left, with 1 investor supporting me, and the 2nd investor plotting how to kill me, since he was angry about how long it was taking, and having super unrealistic expectations that he would become a billionaire in a couple of months. <br>Nevertheless the project finished after 5 years, which was a software suite for professional televesion stations(competition would be systems like Tricaster,etc.)  I sold one copy of the software to a local TV station for $12,000, which was cheap because the competition systems were selling for around $25,000; this was highly specialized software.  <br>I was on a high, as the TV station actually was really happy with the software....but after a few months, they started asking, where is version 2.0?? They said the competition software already had more features, so I promised them a version 2.0 to add more features. But then reality set in.  I was the only programmer left in the company, the software was already becoming outdated.  It would take a long time get v.2.0 out, and the investors wanted a return on their money.   The doubled sided sword, was that this TV station talked to other TV stations, telling them my software was good, but recommending them to wait for v2.0 before buying.  <br>In the end $12,000 for 5 years of nonstop work, and headaches, is sad. <br>To even make things worse, Free, open source software started coming out, even though bad, was starting to be used by the TV stations to save money, reducing the customer base. <br>Let&#39;s be realistic,  nobody pays for software nowadays.  Everyone expects everything to be for &quot;free&quot;.  If someone pays for software it is usually a videogame.  And companies that pay for software have their own software development teams to make their own software.   And to make it worse there are literraly slave shops in India, and China making software for almost no pay.<br>The whole story of making some stupid android app and becoming a millionaire is really castles in the sky.  <br>I not sure why this lie is so readily perpetuated on youtube.  I think most people would be smarter to believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth fairy.",

With only 2 yrs prior of ftenddv at college level curriculum (BCS Mnr, UI/X + Motion Design Mjr) I&#39;m completely aloof to the various notions on &quot;logic&quot; functions from a general sense. Specifically, if or is a function&#39;s back end specific, if function even makes sense in section of block (x), if (x) is redundant &amp; could be optimized by better functions, how to ensure muscle memory of foundational logics, and if my mental library of if/then/TF statements is even applicable or reccomended in each scenario, all from a pretty general sense. What I&#39;m getting at isn&#39;t a general <i>&#39;why&#39;</i> or <i>&#39;how&#39;</i> various coded functions work,  which I far less oft struggle with. Compared to my pulsating migraine of the <i>&#39;when&#39;</i> for integrations, back end procedures, etc in many areas. For example, I botch my work by fully overcomplicating what needs to take place in given situations, because of the more constant issues I face of entirely not realizing &quot;wait I must do that there too?/real time knowledge/general back end communications weighed from &#39;necessarily important&#39; to &#39;sure but totally unnecessary.&#39; Further, I wish there was a guided searchable roadmap so that I can better flow through these scenarios by best adding the back end nuances across a big bank of examples to study and master. I&#39;m assuming such a tool exists, as I want to spend my time building and making mistakes to overcome, yet not bounce into a cement wall that I paint a rabbit hole on to, without carving that hole through. While I wait for that inevitable click or epiphany, I hope I was able to get through to one superhero that can guide me through this. Far too many times am I seeing a new example online or discussion as if the optimal concepts are widely adopted across any scenario, correctly feeling like the minority that just didn&#39;t know about that grand rule to &quot;always do (x) here in this area.&quot; But I&#39;m not even on the same page, struggling not with the structure, but with knowing this concept even exists or never exists in the first place. I know multiple options can be closely optimal in cases, however i have a locked playable npc without any name or knowledge thereof. Ignorance is piss!",

So I asked myself how difficult would it be to create a file manager which suck a little bit less and I started... I created HiFile which may have a motto &quot;a file manager which sucks a bit less&quot; :) And for those who try to google it, yeah, it is nothing revolutionary new, just oldschool &quot;total commander&quot; style manager with some hopefully clever and handy solutions which make my own work faster. And no, it is not yet finished, it still needs some polishing... And most importantly it already made me some 200 bucks :)",

If there\u2019s a need or solves a problem people have, or if it helps a person go from their current state and help them achieve their dream state of some kind, or makes their life easier (convenience), then chances are, your service will work. Also nothing is done solo. You\u2019ll do the programming, UX/UI design, QA testing, marketing, negotiating with investors and future buyers, and be responsible with everything. You will easily get burnt out doing it so it\u2019s best to delegate and divide the responsibilities as you can, which is where your outreaching skills happen. That\u2019s why a lot of those tech startups end up succeeding. You needa hold 20 different positions when doing this. Many have tried, only few succeeded and you need to be OBSESSED with your craft to truly be successful in it. Most will choose the software engineering route and work for some tech company making 150k a year with insane growth benefits, but very few are bold and crazy enough to try and go all or nothing. Many fail trying to achieve this dream. It\u2019s not for everyone. Those that are bold, I\u2019m rooting for you. The sky is the limit.",

    "comment-1609": "I have worked as a software developer for well over 20 years. I have worked in other people&#39;s start ups, in big companies, my own start up, freelance and even in a government agency.  Meaning, I have about seen it all.  <br>First and foremost most of what is presented on youtube about working in software is wrong, and intentionally misleading.  <br>Where I made the most money was either in a big company or in a government agency.  It is also where I did the least amount of programming.  In the start up&#39;s of other people is where I did the most amount of programming and very long hours, and made much less money, but ironically had &quot;more fun&quot;(..sort of...) because I was actually programming systems that were &quot;revolutionary&quot; in a sense that they had not been done before. <br>Working freelance was by far the worse job.  Those contracting have unrealistic expectations, and want to pay almost nothing.  I would highly recommend staying away from freelance work, unless you are homeless and starving, and even then you will probably make more money per hour as a dishwasher.<br>Where my views on software development really changed completely is when I had my own start up company.  That was like being in a rollercoaster and in a washing machine all at the same time. I got a small team together and we started a company, and I had 2 investors to finance it. Before finishing the project, our investors found us more investors, but these investors want to buy out everything, which would make quick money for the original investors, but turn me into a simple employee with some shares(not an owner of the company). I turned the offer down.  The project dragged on, and took about 5 years to finish.  After about the first 2 years I had already lost about 80% of the original team, and after 3 years I was the only person left, with 1 investor supporting me, and the 2nd investor plotting how to kill me, since he was angry about how long it was taking, and having super unrealistic expectations that he would become a billionaire in a couple of months. <br>Nevertheless the project finished after 5 years, which was a software suite for professional televesion stations(competition would be systems like Tricaster,etc.)  I sold one copy of the software to a local TV station for $12,000, which was cheap because the competition systems were selling for around $25,000; this was highly specialized software.  <br>I was on a high, as the TV station actually was really happy with the software....but after a few months, they started asking, where is version 2.0?? They said the competition software already had more features, so I promised them a version 2.0 to add more features. But then reality set in.  I was the only programmer left in the company, the software was already becoming outdated.  It would take a long time get v.2.0 out, and the investors wanted a return on their money.   The doubled sided sword, was that this TV station talked to other TV stations, telling them my software was good, but recommending them to wait for v2.0 before buying.  <br>In the end $12,000 for 5 years of nonstop work, and headaches, is sad. <br>To even make things worse, Free, open source software started coming out, even though bad, was starting to be used by the TV stations to save money, reducing the customer base. <br>Let&#39;s be realistic,  nobody pays for software nowadays.  Everyone expects everything to be for &quot;free&quot;.  If someone pays for software it is usually a videogame.  And companies that pay for software have their own software development teams to make their own software.   And to make it worse there are literraly slave shops in India, and China making software for almost no pay.<br>The whole story of making some stupid android app and becoming a millionaire is really castles in the sky.  <br>I not sure why this lie is so readily perpetuated on youtube.  I think most people would be smarter to believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth fairy.",

I&#39;m so much happier now coding projects for others while making good money instead of failing over and over and over again on something I&#39;m not good at because it&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; to be a solopreneur.",

Specifically, if or is a function&#39;s back end specific, if function even makes sense in section of block (x), if (x) is redundant &amp; could be optimized by better functions, how to ensure muscle memory of foundational logics, and if my mental library of if/then/TF statements is even applicable or reccomended in each scenario, all from a pretty general sense. What I&#39;m getting at isn&#39;t a general <i>&#39;why&#39;</i> or <i>&#39;how&#39;</i> various coded functions work,  which I far less oft struggle with. Compared to my pulsating migraine of the <i>&#39;when&#39;</i> for integrations, back end procedures, etc in many areas. For example, I botch my work by fully overcomplicating what needs to take place in given situations, because of the more constant issues I face of entirely not realizing &quot;wait I must do that there too?/real time knowledge/general back end communications weighed from &#39;necessarily important&#39; to &#39;sure but totally unnecessary.&#39; Further, I wish there was a guided searchable roadmap so that I can better flow through these scenarios by best adding the back end nuances across a big bank of examples to study and master. I&#39;m assuming such a tool exists, as I want to spend my time building and making mistakes to overcome, yet not bounce into a cement wall that I paint a rabbit hole on to, without carving that hole through. While I wait for that inevitable click or epiphany, I hope I was able to get through to one superhero that can guide me through this. Far too many times am I seeing a new example online or discussion as if the optimal concepts are widely adopted across any scenario, correctly feeling like the minority that just didn&#39;t know about that grand rule to &quot;always do (x) here in this area.&quot; But I&#39;m not even on the same page, struggling not with the structure, but with knowing this concept even exists or never exists in the first place. I know multiple options can be closely optimal in cases, however i have a locked playable npc without any name or knowledge thereof. Ignorance is piss!",

    "comment-2464": "Solo developers only work if your marketing skills are top notch. Your product is only as good as how it responds to the market and how it\u2019s presented. If there\u2019s a need or solves a problem people have, or if it helps a person go from their current state and help them achieve their dream state of some kind, or makes their life easier (convenience), then chances are, your service will work. Also nothing is done solo. You\u2019ll do the programming, UX/UI design, QA testing, marketing, negotiating with investors and future buyers, and be responsible with everything. You will easily get burnt out doing it so it\u2019s best to delegate and divide the responsibilities as you can, which is where your outreaching skills happen. That\u2019s why a lot of those tech startups end up succeeding. You needa hold 20 different positions when doing this. Many have tried, only few succeeded and you need to be OBSESSED with your craft to truly be successful in it. Most will choose the software engineering route and work for some tech company making 150k a year with insane growth benefits, but very few are bold and crazy enough to try and go all or nothing. Many fail trying to achieve this dream. It\u2019s not for everyone. Those that are bold, I\u2019m rooting for you. The sky is the limit.",

    "comment-2598": "I have worked as a software developer for well over 20 years. I have worked in other people&#39;s start ups, in big companies, my own start up, freelance and even in a government agency.  Meaning, I have about seen it all.  <br>First and foremost most of what is presented on youtube about working in software is wrong, and intentionally misleading.  <br>Where I made the most money was either in a big company or in a government agency.  It is also where I did the least amount of programming.  In the start up&#39;s of other people is where I did the most amount of programming and very long hours, and made much less money, but ironically had &quot;more fun&quot;(..sort of...) because I was actually programming systems that were &quot;revolutionary&quot; in a sense that they had not been done before. <br>Working freelance was by far the worse job.  Those contracting have unrealistic expectations, and want to pay almost nothing.  I would highly recommend staying away from freelance work, unless you are homeless and starving, and even then you will probably make more money per hour as a dishwasher.<br>Where my views on software development really changed completely is when I had my own start up company.  That was like being in a rollercoaster and in a washing machine all at the same time. I got a small team together and we started a company, and I had 2 investors to finance it. Before finishing the project, our investors found us more investors, but these investors want to buy out everything, which would make quick money for the original investors, but turn me into a simple employee with some shares(not an owner of the company). I turned the offer down.  The project dragged on, and took about 5 years to finish.  After about the first 2 years I had already lost about 80% of the original team, and after 3 years I was the only person left, with 1 investor supporting me, and the 2nd investor plotting how to kill me, since he was angry about how long it was taking, and having super unrealistic expectations that he would become a billionaire in a couple of months. <br>Nevertheless the project finished after 5 years, which was a software suite for professional televesion stations(competition would be systems like Tricaster,etc.)  I sold one copy of the software to a local TV station for $12,000, which was cheap because the competition systems were selling for around $25,000; this was highly specialized software.  <br>I was on a high, as the TV station actually was really happy with the software....but after a few months, they started asking, where is version 2.0?? They said the competition software already had more features, so I promised them a version 2.0 to add more features. But then reality set in.  I was the only programmer left in the company, the software was already becoming outdated.  It would take a long time get v.2.0 out, and the investors wanted a return on their money.   The doubled sided sword, was that this TV station talked to other TV stations, telling them my software was good, but recommending them to wait for v2.0 before buying.  <br>In the end $12,000 for 5 years of nonstop work, and headaches, is sad. <br>To even make things worse, Free, open source software started coming out, even though bad, was starting to be used by the TV stations to save money, reducing the customer base. <br>Let&#39;s be realistic,  nobody pays for software nowadays.  Everyone expects everything to be for &quot;free&quot;.  If someone pays for software it is usually a videogame.  And companies that pay for software have their own software development teams to make their own software.   And to make it worse there are literraly slave shops in India, and China making software for almost no pay.<br>The whole story of making some stupid android app and becoming a millionaire is really castles in the sky.  <br>I not sure why this lie is so readily perpetuated on youtube.  I think most people would be smarter to believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth fairy.",

With only 2 yrs prior of ftenddv at college level curriculum (BCS Mnr, UI/X + Motion Design Mjr) I&#39;m completely aloof to the various notions on &quot;logic&quot; functions from a general sense. Specifically, if or is a function&#39;s back end specific, if function even makes sense in section of block (x), if (x) is redundant &amp; could be optimized by better functions, how to ensure muscle memory of foundational logics, and if my mental library of if/then/TF statements is even applicable or reccomended in each scenario, all from a pretty general sense. What I&#39;m getting at isn&#39;t a general <i>&#39;why&#39;</i> or <i>&#39;how&#39;</i> various coded functions work,  which I far less oft struggle with. Compared to my pulsating migraine of the <i>&#39;when&#39;</i> for integrations, back end procedures, etc in many areas. For example, I botch my work by fully overcomplicating what needs to take place in given situations, because of the more constant issues I face of entirely not realizing &quot;wait I must do that there too?/real time knowledge/general back end communications weighed from &#39;necessarily important&#39; to &#39;sure but totally unnecessary.&#39; Further, I wish there was a guided searchable roadmap so that I can better flow through these scenarios by best adding the back end nuances across a big bank of examples to study and master. I&#39;m assuming such a tool exists, as I want to spend my time building and making mistakes to overcome, yet not bounce into a cement wall that I paint a rabbit hole on to, without carving that hole through. While I wait for that inevitable click or epiphany, I hope I was able to get through to one superhero that can guide me through this. Far too many times am I seeing a new example online or discussion as if the optimal concepts are widely adopted across any scenario, correctly feeling like the minority that just didn&#39;t know about that grand rule to &quot;always do (x) here in this area.&quot; But I&#39;m not even on the same page, struggling not with the structure, but with knowing this concept even exists or never exists in the first place. I know multiple options can be closely optimal in cases, however i have a locked playable npc without any name or knowledge thereof. Ignorance is piss!",

If there\u2019s a need or solves a problem people have, or if it helps a person go from their current state and help them achieve their dream state of some kind, or makes their life easier (convenience), then chances are, your service will work. Also nothing is done solo. You\u2019ll do the programming, UX/UI design, QA testing, marketing, negotiating with investors and future buyers, and be responsible with everything. You will easily get burnt out doing it so it\u2019s best to delegate and divide the responsibilities as you can, which is where your outreaching skills happen. That\u2019s why a lot of those tech startups end up succeeding. You needa hold 20 different positions when doing this. Many have tried, only few succeeded and you need to be OBSESSED with your craft to truly be successful in it. Most will choose the software engineering route and work for some tech company making 150k a year with insane growth benefits, but very few are bold and crazy enough to try and go all or nothing. Many fail trying to achieve this dream. It\u2019s not for everyone. Those that are bold, I\u2019m rooting for you. The sky is the limit.",

    "comment-3587": "I have worked as a software developer for well over 20 years. I have worked in other people&#39;s start ups, in big companies, my own start up, freelance and even in a government agency.  Meaning, I have about seen it all.  <br>First and foremost most of what is presented on youtube about working in software is wrong, and intentionally misleading.  <br>Where I made the most money was either in a big company or in a government agency.  It is also where I did the least amount of programming.  In the start up&#39;s of other people is where I did the most amount of programming and very long hours, and made much less money, but ironically had &quot;more fun&quot;(..sort of...) because I was actually programming systems that were &quot;revolutionary&quot; in a sense that they had not been done before. <br>Working freelance was by far the worse job.  Those contracting have unrealistic expectations, and want to pay almost nothing.  I would highly recommend staying away from freelance work, unless you are homeless and starving, and even then you will probably make more money per hour as a dishwasher.<br>Where my views on software development really changed completely is when I had my own start up company.  That was like being in a rollercoaster and in a washing machine all at the same time. I got a small team together and we started a company, and I had 2 investors to finance it. Before finishing the project, our investors found us more investors, but these investors want to buy out everything, which would make quick money for the original investors, but turn me into a simple employee with some shares(not an owner of the company). I turned the offer down.  The project dragged on, and took about 5 years to finish.  After about the first 2 years I had already lost about 80% of the original team, and after 3 years I was the only person left, with 1 investor supporting me, and the 2nd investor plotting how to kill me, since he was angry about how long it was taking, and having super unrealistic expectations that he would become a billionaire in a couple of months. <br>Nevertheless the project finished after 5 years, which was a software suite for professional televesion stations(competition would be systems like Tricaster,etc.)  I sold one copy of the software to a local TV station for $12,000, which was cheap because the competition systems were selling for around $25,000; this was highly specialized software.  <br>I was on a high, as the TV station actually was really happy with the software....but after a few months, they started asking, where is version 2.0?? They said the competition software already had more features, so I promised them a version 2.0 to add more features. But then reality set in.  I was the only programmer left in the company, the software was already becoming outdated.  It would take a long time get v.2.0 out, and the investors wanted a return on their money.   The doubled sided sword, was that this TV station talked to other TV stations, telling them my software was good, but recommending them to wait for v2.0 before buying.  <br>In the end $12,000 for 5 years of nonstop work, and headaches, is sad. <br>To even make things worse, Free, open source software started coming out, even though bad, was starting to be used by the TV stations to save money, reducing the customer base. <br>Let&#39;s be realistic,  nobody pays for software nowadays.  Everyone expects everything to be for &quot;free&quot;.  If someone pays for software it is usually a videogame.  And companies that pay for software have their own software development teams to make their own software.   And to make it worse there are literraly slave shops in India, and China making software for almost no pay.<br>The whole story of making some stupid android app and becoming a millionaire is really castles in the sky.  <br>I not sure why this lie is so readily perpetuated on youtube.  I think most people would be smarter to believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth fairy.",

With only 2 yrs prior of ftenddv at college level curriculum (BCS Mnr, UI/X + Motion Design Mjr) I&#39;m completely aloof to the various notions on &quot;logic&quot; functions from a general sense. Specifically, if or is a function&#39;s back end specific, if function even makes sense in section of block (x), if (x) is redundant &amp; could be optimized by better functions, how to ensure muscle memory of foundational logics, and if my mental library of if/then/TF statements is even applicable or reccomended in each scenario, all from a pretty general sense. What I&#39;m getting at isn&#39;t a general <i>&#39;why&#39;</i> or <i>&#39;how&#39;</i> various coded functions work,  which I far less oft struggle with. Compared to my pulsating migraine of the <i>&#39;when&#39;</i> for integrations, back end procedures, etc in many areas. For example, I botch my work by fully overcomplicating what needs to take place in given situations, because of the more constant issues I face of entirely not realizing &quot;wait I must do that there too?/real time knowledge/general back end communications weighed from &#39;necessarily important&#39; to &#39;sure but totally unnecessary.&#39; Further, I wish there was a guided searchable roadmap so that I can better flow through these scenarios by best adding the back end nuances across a big bank of examples to study and master. I&#39;m assuming such a tool exists, as I want to spend my time building and making mistakes to overcome, yet not bounce into a cement wall that I paint a rabbit hole on to, without carving that hole through. While I wait for that inevitable click or epiphany, I hope I was able to get through to one superhero that can guide me through this. Far too many times am I seeing a new example online or discussion as if the optimal concepts are widely adopted across any scenario, correctly feeling like the minority that just didn&#39;t know about that grand rule to &quot;always do (x) here in this area.&quot; But I&#39;m not even on the same page, struggling not with the structure, but with knowing this concept even exists or never exists in the first place. I know multiple options can be closely optimal in cases, however i have a locked playable npc without any name or knowledge thereof. Ignorance is piss!",

Her voice is just so off-putting, Even with the copious amounts of autotune. It&#39;s so apparent that whenever she goes to hit some of those notes that she clearly can&#39;t hit properly, That&#39;s when they either up the music or up the autotune to mask it.

It&#39;s just so well done and you can tell a huge amount of effort and time was put into this. I&#39;m doing my best to ignore any bias caused by nostalgia.

The original had a tone that felt like the animatronics are welcoming you but there&#39;s something wrong, something in the air. In this one, the vocals are more lifelike as if they&#39;re welcoming you back. The bad feeling isn&#39;t there anymore, because you already went through it.

When I play those songs, so many great memories come back to me of when I first heard them. Over time, I found more and more songs (like this), that are FIRE!

The reason Ballora didn&#39;t do the same is because she didn&#39;t fully recognise her son as she died many years before he was an adult. At least I think. BTW  (no hate) but when circus baby says someone purple murdered me that&#39;s kinda wrong bc Elizabeth was warned by William not to go near Circus Baby but didn&#39;t listen and technically got herself murdered by her ice cream function . Unless she is referring to the fact that her father didn&#39;t stop her doing this or because William made Cirus Baby  for Elizabeth and designed it to trapped children temporarily but it malfunctioned and she might be blaming him for the malfunction which lead to her death. However ,  if someone asks her if  William killed her she gets all angry and defensive claiming that it was her fault that she is dead. There is another song referencing this and   it&#39;s called Never coming home  and it&#39;s Elizabeth and she says : &#39;Father said no but I found a way how would I have known that she would take me &#39;",

Also William wasn&#39;t actually purple, it&#39;s been explained by Scott multiple times the in the mini games the only reason that William appears is purple is so he would stand out as a character in the shadows but would be visible. <br>It&#39;s really great how a song that apparently the community sees as such a great thing has absolutely no concept of the continuity in the lore of the actual story.",

All of this time and effort put into this animation and the person that gave the direction to the animator couldn&#39;t bother telling them the eye color difference.

It&#39;s either they&#39;re protecting themselves or really thirsty for revenge that&#39;s why they&#39;re scaring (there might a better word besides this, just can&#39;t remember) the security guard.<br><br>This is only the way I understand the message of the part.

It may just be part of the reason we&#39;re still friends today. This song carries so much meaning even for a kid like me who never knew about its origins. Which i think really shows how amazing it is- the beat and the lyrics are so easy to remember and so catchy that it&#39;s a great song to sing together with friends, regardless of if you&#39;re a fnaf fan or not. so thanks, JT.

Listening to it now feels like viewing shard of childhood memories and though I wasn&#39;t here back when original released - I am here <b>now</b> and... I adore it.<br>\r<br>...that said, the line at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> keeps bothering me. I know original song released before game came out and it was fine to assume that, but now, when we know story of the game, and the REMASTERED version of the track doesn&#39;t change or rethought this line...

So if you are going to do any other songs on the sister location franchise make sure you do not make this mistake and another thing is we dont know if the other sister location animatronics were souls by kids killed by afton because at the time sister location was made afton would be alive because he would have the knowledge to make them, but we do know that baby was designed to have an in-built scooper for kids as she would not need all the space in the chest cavity but there you go.

Sister location was the year me and one of my close cousins spent so much time together so when we saw the sister location trailer we were hyped and waiting on the music videos and teasers. A few months later I think was when &quot;join us for a bite&quot; released and it was one of my favorites so this remake makes me so happy.<br><br>Edit: I forgot to include a few gripes soooo.....<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> I felt that there was something off with Baby&#39;s Shutting off animation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a> Balora&#39;s dance felt too fluid as it would make more sense for it to be more finicky like an animatronic. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m06s\">2:06</a> I felt that the Animatronics jaws didn&#39;t move enough and didn&#39;t hit as much as the originals. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> Same thing like Balora it felt too fluid and human like which crossed the uncanny valley for me but that doesn&#39;t mean I hate the fluidness entirely, some scenes look stunning like when the face-plates moved and this particular scene at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m47s\">2:47</a> which I very much like. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> Idk but Baby&#39;s model is a bit off I think its that the head isn&#39;t lower down.<br><br>Overall the Music is an overall improvement, outstanding lighting that reminds me of &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, and TOP notch attention to detail!",

Everything added in this remaster enhances the original version and the message and storyline of the song stays the same. Truly a work of art.

    "comment-9792": "Here is my overall musical analysis of the remaster of Join Us For A Bite, since I think it needs a comparison to the original 2016 version (please also bare in mind that THIS IS MY OPINION);<br><br>Pros:<br>- A lot more depth in the instrumental elements to the song <br>- Less compression/distortion in the drums and the bass<br>- Acoustic guitar strums are easier to hear<br>- Improved 3D sound<br>- The highs end sounds of the song feel more punchy and clear<br><br>Cons:<br>- A bit too much distortion and autotune in the voiceover (the 2016 version had this as well, though I believe it was at a lower amount of autotune, which helped it sink in with the song)<br>- The low end sounds don\u2019t feel as deep as they originally did in the 2016 version<br>-  Drums are probably a bit far on the high end of the sound of the songs<br>- Some of the synth instrumental notes/chords don\u2019t feel as drawn out (probably because they are either compressed or filtered)<br>- (Personal Recommendation) It would be interesting for the electric guitar appear more often in the instrumental<br><br>However, the visuals to the music video of the remaster are definitely an improvement and the production quality of the animation shows the evolution in the FNAF SFM\u2019s compared to the older animations between 2015-2018. So thumbs up the people that helped out with the animation. But also a thumbs up to the JT Music crew for giving one of the most essential ever created FNAF songs new life.",

I began to freak out, explaining to her that I LOVED FNAF. Ever since then, we&#39;ve been the best of friends.

In the original, it was Andrea&#39;s primary singing voice on top of a track running her voice but altered to be several octaves lower. It was subtle, but once you hear it you can&#39;t unhear it. I always kind of figured it was meant to be Freddy doing backup vocals LOL. In the new one, though, there&#39;s no lower register track-- it sounds like several versions of Andrea&#39;s normal voice.

I remember how hyped I was about the release for this game, knowing it would be one of the first with actual in-game narrative, a stranger atmosphere, and more interactive puzzles. As much as I hate to admit it, my fursona seen in my PFP here was born from the FNAF era of furries as well, and I&#39;d be lying if I said this game didn&#39;t have any impact on my own creative works. Great to see how much Skull&#39;s musical talent has grown too, with so much new effects and mastering in this version of the song.",

The electric guitar may have seemed like a nice touch but it&#39;s not really that type of song and it felt out of place.  This really does not beat the original and I&#39;ll go for that over this any time.",

I used to hate Fnaf mostly because I was a dumb six-year-old, who thought it was spooky. I remember my first introduction to Fnaf was actually a CookieSwirlC video. But I\u2019m pretty sure you were the first reason why I ever gave a chance at liking Fnaf, because it was this song. I had this song stuck in my head for weeks. I remember literally going downstairs on Christmas Eve to peek my presents, and realizing that I had this song stuck in my head, telling myself not to like it, because it\u2019s a Fnaf song, and I hate Fnaf, cuz it\u2019s scary. Then I watched a game theory video about Fnaf VR. It took me a couple more months after that but after that I was sold on the fandom and I joined. Thank you so much, JT. If you would never made join us for a bite in the first place, I would\u2019ve never been a part of this amazing fandom. And thank you all for reading through this.\u2764",

The video mixed with the new mixing and Andrea&#39;s vocals still remaining true to the original video just adds a whole new layer of what &quot;Join Us For A Bite&quot; did for the brand. It doesn&#39;t even have Skull&#39;s vocals but it still feels so iconic for what Skull and Pat have both worked on over the years, Andrea just becoming like a staple unit in songs being released. Sometimes I&#39;ll load up a playlist with the original FNAF raps that Skull did for each game in the golden age of the channel. Thank you guys for making my childhood, and just to know you guys are based in North Carolina makes me even happier to have it be my home state. You guys have done so much for the nerdy kids in middle school who were able to bond over nerdcore.",

I&#39;ve got to be honest, I personally don&#39;t really think it needed one.

I have been around the game since the demo and I remember my cousin coming over, telling me about this &quot;scary horror Chuckie Cheese game&quot; that just released a demo, and we played it on their laptop. That same cousin got me into Undertale when its demo came out. Those years started so much for me. 2013 and 2014 were really something. I always kept up with the FNAF games, and when Sister Location came out in 2016, I found my absolute favorite in the series. This song, that game, this community. It all has done something amazing for me that I can never give back enough in return. This song, is my childhood. This song, brought me joy in a way that cannot be described. <br>You truly realize how much time has passed, when you look back at the dates.. the times. The memories you have feel timeless, and it&#39;s not until you look at the written date of some things, that you actually realize... That you are older. You have grown up. That this, has been beside you throughout that time. That those times where you would talk about one kid being an absolute master at gaming simply for beating FNAF&#39;s 5th or 6th nights, are in the past...<br><br>Thank you JT Music and friends...

Her voice is just so off-putting, Even with the copious amounts of autotune. It&#39;s so apparent that whenever she goes to hit some of those notes that she clearly can&#39;t hit properly, That&#39;s when they either up the music or up the autotune to mask it.

You are under review.<br><br>- The opening poses are magnificent<br>- The lighting is impeccable<br>- Love the transition in Ballora&#39;s mouth<br>- I appreciate the more possessed and unnatural movement of Bonnie<br>- I like how Springtrap moves so much more human-like, very neat<br>- The minireenas spell BABY, that is such a cool detail<br>- Elizabeth&#39;s death, from the dust to the animation, the lighting, everything is beautiful<br>- Purple smiling camera is the cutest FNAF character, but also a very cool detail with the dots forming said smile<br>- I don&#39;t like that Funtime Foxy model, but it&#39;s passable<br>- While I don&#39;t like the Funtime Foxy model, the scene with the flashing lights and FFx swaying back and forth as he makes his way over is pretty terrifying<br>- Ennard&#39;s animation is so fluid and smooth, I love it, masterfully done<br>- Pretty sure that&#39;s Sebastian from the The Evil Within franchise, but it&#39;s better than Rick Astley<br><br>Final Verdict: I absolutely ADORE this animation and song.

The original had a tone that felt like the animatronics are welcoming you but there&#39;s something wrong, something in the air. In this one, the vocals are more lifelike as if they&#39;re welcoming you back. The bad feeling isn&#39;t there anymore, because you already went through it.

When I play those songs, so many great memories come back to me of when I first heard them. Over time, I found more and more songs (like this), that are FIRE!

The reason Ballora didn&#39;t do the same is because she didn&#39;t fully recognise her son as she died many years before he was an adult. At least I think. BTW  (no hate) but when circus baby says someone purple murdered me that&#39;s kinda wrong bc Elizabeth was warned by William not to go near Circus Baby but didn&#39;t listen and technically got herself murdered by her ice cream function . Unless she is referring to the fact that her father didn&#39;t stop her doing this or because William made Cirus Baby  for Elizabeth and designed it to trapped children temporarily but it malfunctioned and she might be blaming him for the malfunction which lead to her death. However ,  if someone asks her if  William killed her she gets all angry and defensive claiming that it was her fault that she is dead. There is another song referencing this and   it&#39;s called Never coming home  and it&#39;s Elizabeth and she says : &#39;Father said no but I found a way how would I have known that she would take me &#39;",

Also William wasn&#39;t actually purple, it&#39;s been explained by Scott multiple times the in the mini games the only reason that William appears is purple is so he would stand out as a character in the shadows but would be visible. <br>It&#39;s really great how a song that apparently the community sees as such a great thing has absolutely no concept of the continuity in the lore of the actual story.",
    "comment-14269": "The fact that the person giving the direction in this video made baby&#39;s eyes green while she&#39;s grabbing Elizabeth has absolutely no concept of this series. Even someone new to the series knows that baby&#39;s eyes were blue before grabbing Elizabeth. All of this time and effort put into this animation and the person that gave the direction to the animator couldn&#39;t bother telling them the eye color difference. It&#39;s absolutely depressing the lack of detail in this video that everyone apparently is praising as if it was handmade by God.",

It may just be part of the reason we&#39;re still friends today. This song carries so much meaning even for a kid like me who never knew about its origins. Which i think really shows how amazing it is- the beat and the lyrics are so easy to remember and so catchy that it&#39;s a great song to sing together with friends, regardless of if you&#39;re a fnaf fan or not. so thanks, JT.

This isn\u2019t fnaf.\u201d But once I gave the song a chance, like everyone else I fell in love with this song. Seeing this come back and in an actual good remix, my God. The nostalgia and goosebumps I got from this was insane. Truly a legendary fnaf song. Great job JT Music!!",

    "comment-15936": "I actually have a long story with this song. \r<br>\r<br>Back at 2017 when I found your channel I loved your raps and didn&#39;t understood why this song gone SO viral. <br>I deeply respect the job Harry101UK has done in creating these visuals - makes me wonder how many kids became robotics enthusiasts because of Scott designs and reimaginations SFM creators did over the years.<br>I love how emotional this song is and how it swaps between talking to in-game protagonist and you, fan of this series. Listening to it now feels like viewing shard of childhood memories and though I wasn&#39;t here back when original released - I am here <b>now</b> and... I adore it.<br>\r<br>...that said, the line at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> keeps bothering me. I know original song released before game came out and it was fine to assume that, but now, when we know story of the game, and the REMASTERED version of the track doesn&#39;t change or rethought this line... It just makes me sad knowing that this near perfect song and animation would keep such an obvious miss that probably won&#39;t be changed forever.",

So if you are going to do any other songs on the sister location franchise make sure you do not make this mistake and another thing is we dont know if the other sister location animatronics were souls by kids killed by afton because at the time sister location was made afton would be alive because he would have the knowledge to make them, but we do know that baby was designed to have an in-built scooper for kids as she would not need all the space in the chest cavity but there you go.

A few months later I think was when &quot;join us for a bite&quot; released and it was one of my favorites so this remake makes me so happy.<br><br>Edit: I forgot to include a few gripes soooo.....<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> I felt that there was something off with Baby&#39;s Shutting off animation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a> Balora&#39;s dance felt too fluid as it would make more sense for it to be more finicky like an animatronic. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m06s\">2:06</a> I felt that the Animatronics jaws didn&#39;t move enough and didn&#39;t hit as much as the originals. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> Same thing like Balora it felt too fluid and human like which crossed the uncanny valley for me but that doesn&#39;t mean I hate the fluidness entirely, some scenes look stunning like when the face-plates moved and this particular scene at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m47s\">2:47</a> which I very much like. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> Idk but Baby&#39;s model is a bit off I think its that the head isn&#39;t lower down.<br><br>Overall the Music is an overall improvement, outstanding lighting that reminds me of &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, and TOP notch attention to detail!",

    "comment-17198": "Here is my overall musical analysis of the remaster of Join Us For A Bite, since I think it needs a comparison to the original 2016 version (please also bare in mind that THIS IS MY OPINION);<br><br>Pros:<br>- A lot more depth in the instrumental elements to the song <br>- Less compression/distortion in the drums and the bass<br>- Acoustic guitar strums are easier to hear<br>- Improved 3D sound<br>- The highs end sounds of the song feel more punchy and clear<br><br>Cons:<br>- A bit too much distortion and autotune in the voiceover (the 2016 version had this as well, though I believe it was at a lower amount of autotune, which helped it sink in with the song)<br>- The low end sounds don\u2019t feel as deep as they originally did in the 2016 version<br>-  Drums are probably a bit far on the high end of the sound of the songs<br>- Some of the synth instrumental notes/chords don\u2019t feel as drawn out (probably because they are either compressed or filtered)<br>- (Personal Recommendation) It would be interesting for the electric guitar appear more often in the instrumental<br><br>However, the visuals to the music video of the remaster are definitely an improvement and the production quality of the animation shows the evolution in the FNAF SFM\u2019s compared to the older animations between 2015-2018. So thumbs up the people that helped out with the animation. But also a thumbs up to the JT Music crew for giving one of the most essential ever created FNAF songs new life.",

She said &quot;-and Freddy told us your an organ donor.&quot; I remember asking her what she was singing, and she told me that I wouldn&#39;t know it; she told me, a bit afterwards, that it was a Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s song. I began to freak out, explaining to her that I LOVED FNAF. Ever since then, we&#39;ve been the best of friends. Whenever she moved out-of-state (I still talk to her, though it&#39;s not as often as I&#39;d like) I changed her ring-tone to Join Us For A Bite.<br><br>  The fact that this song was remastered, and that the remastered-version sounds awesome (with great animations) really does mean a lot to me.

In the original, it was Andrea&#39;s primary singing voice on top of a track running her voice but altered to be several octaves lower. It was subtle, but once you hear it you can&#39;t unhear it. I always kind of figured it was meant to be Freddy doing backup vocals LOL. In the new one, though, there&#39;s no lower register track-- it sounds like several versions of Andrea&#39;s normal voice.

I don&#39;t know if I can call it &quot;nostalgia&quot; like all these Gen Z and tiktoker comments are, but this really did make me realize just how long it&#39;s been. I remember how hyped I was about the release for this game, knowing it would be one of the first with actual in-game narrative, a stranger atmosphere, and more interactive puzzles. As much as I hate to admit it, my fursona seen in my PFP here was born from the FNAF era of furries as well, and I&#39;d be lying if I said this game didn&#39;t have any impact on my own creative works. Great to see how much Skull&#39;s musical talent has grown too, with so much new effects and mastering in this version of the song.",

I used to hate Fnaf mostly because I was a dumb six-year-old, who thought it was spooky. I remember my first introduction to Fnaf was actually a CookieSwirlC video. But I\u2019m pretty sure you were the first reason why I ever gave a chance at liking Fnaf, because it was this song. I had this song stuck in my head for weeks. I remember literally going downstairs on Christmas Eve to peek my presents, and realizing that I had this song stuck in my head, telling myself not to like it, because it\u2019s a Fnaf song, and I hate Fnaf, cuz it\u2019s scary. Then I watched a game theory video about Fnaf VR. It took me a couple more months after that but after that I was sold on the fandom and I joined. Thank you so much, JT.

    "comment-18833": "Over the many years I&#39;ve watched this channel I&#39;ve seen it evolve into something that is a staple when you look into the nerdcore genre. The video mixed with the new mixing and Andrea&#39;s vocals still remaining true to the original video just adds a whole new layer of what &quot;Join Us For A Bite&quot; did for the brand. It doesn&#39;t even have Skull&#39;s vocals but it still feels so iconic for what Skull and Pat have both worked on over the years, Andrea just becoming like a staple unit in songs being released. Sometimes I&#39;ll load up a playlist with the original FNAF raps that Skull did for each game in the golden age of the channel. Thank you guys for making my childhood, and just to know you guys are based in North Carolina makes me even happier to have it be my home state. You guys have done so much for the nerdy kids in middle school who were able to bond over nerdcore.",

This remaster of one of my favorite FNAF songs, &quot;Join Us For A Bite&quot;,  is indeed fantastic! It brought back so much nostalgia feeling from the original. And the visuals, animations, and the realistic aesthetics are indeed very well made and fantastic at the same time. It did give me the chills hearing this, and It also brought back so many memories and the nostalgia! I&#39;m so proud of you, and for those that were involved in the making of this whole remastered version of Join Us For A Bite.",
    "comment-18837": "I love how this remaster, plus the animation, makes it somewhat ominous rather than just cheerful and upbeat, like Fnaf is supposed to be.

    "comment-19189": "Obviously I had to comment. This song holds so many memories for me that when I watched the live, I couldn&#39;t help but tear up. I have been around the game since the demo and I remember my cousin coming over, telling me about this &quot;scary horror Chuckie Cheese game&quot; that just released a demo, and we played it on their laptop. That same cousin got me into Undertale when its demo came out. Those years started so much for me. 2013 and 2014 were really something. I always kept up with the FNAF games, and when Sister Location came out in 2016, I found my absolute favorite in the series. This song, that game, this community. It all has done something amazing for me that I can never give back enough in return. This song, is my childhood. This song, brought me joy in a way that cannot be described. <br>You truly realize how much time has passed, when you look back at the dates.. the times. The memories you have feel timeless, and it&#39;s not until you look at the written date of some things, that you actually realize... That you are older. You have grown up. That this, has been beside you throughout that time. That those times where you would talk about one kid being an absolute master at gaming simply for beating FNAF&#39;s 5th or 6th nights, are in the past...<br><br>Thank you JT Music and friends... This is something... that can never be forgotten. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",

She needs to sing in a completely different key. She is absolutely straining her vocal cords to hit the upper notes, I can hear the strain in her voice. I don&#39;t get why people like this song. Her voice is just so off-putting, Even with the copious amounts of autotune. It&#39;s so apparent that whenever she goes to hit some of those notes that she clearly can&#39;t hit properly, That&#39;s when they either up the music or up the autotune to mask it.

The original had a tone that felt like the animatronics are welcoming you but there&#39;s something wrong, something in the air. In this one, the vocals are more lifelike as if they&#39;re welcoming you back. The bad feeling isn&#39;t there anymore, because you already went through it.

The reason Ballora didn&#39;t do the same is because she didn&#39;t fully recognise her son as she died many years before he was an adult. At least I think. BTW  (no hate) but when circus baby says someone purple murdered me that&#39;s kinda wrong bc Elizabeth was warned by William not to go near Circus Baby but didn&#39;t listen and technically got herself murdered by her ice cream function . Unless she is referring to the fact that her father didn&#39;t stop her doing this or because William made Cirus Baby  for Elizabeth and designed it to trapped children temporarily but it malfunctioned and she might be blaming him for the malfunction which lead to her death. However ,  if someone asks her if  William killed her she gets all angry and defensive claiming that it was her fault that she is dead. There is another song referencing this and   it&#39;s called Never coming home  and it&#39;s Elizabeth and she says : &#39;Father said no but I found a way how would I have known that she would take me &#39;",

    "comment-21674": "The person who wrote the song obviously doesn&#39;t understand the lore. &quot;Somebody purple murdered me&quot; actually Elizabeth was not intentionally murdered, William her father told her not to go near baby, So if anything she should be mad at herself for not listening to her father. Also William wasn&#39;t actually purple, it&#39;s been explained by Scott multiple times the in the mini games the only reason that William appears is purple is so he would stand out as a character in the shadows but would be visible. <br>It&#39;s really great how a song that apparently the community sees as such a great thing has absolutely no concept of the continuity in the lore of the actual story.",
    "comment-21675": "The fact that the person giving the direction in this video made baby&#39;s eyes green while she&#39;s grabbing Elizabeth has absolutely no concept of this series. Even someone new to the series knows that baby&#39;s eyes were blue before grabbing Elizabeth. All of this time and effort put into this animation and the person that gave the direction to the animator couldn&#39;t bother telling them the eye color difference. It&#39;s absolutely depressing the lack of detail in this video that everyone apparently is praising as if it was handmade by God.",

It may just be part of the reason we&#39;re still friends today. This song carries so much meaning even for a kid like me who never knew about its origins. Which i think really shows how amazing it is- the beat and the lyrics are so easy to remember and so catchy that it&#39;s a great song to sing together with friends, regardless of if you&#39;re a fnaf fan or not. so thanks, JT.

Listening to it now feels like viewing shard of childhood memories and though I wasn&#39;t here back when original released - I am here <b>now</b> and... I adore it.<br>\r<br>...that said, the line at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> keeps bothering me. I know original song released before game came out and it was fine to assume that, but now, when we know story of the game, and the REMASTERED version of the track doesn&#39;t change or rethought this line... It just makes me sad knowing that this near perfect song and animation would keep such an obvious miss that probably won&#39;t be changed forever.",

So if you are going to do any other songs on the sister location franchise make sure you do not make this mistake and another thing is we dont know if the other sister location animatronics were souls by kids killed by afton because at the time sister location was made afton would be alive because he would have the knowledge to make them, but we do know that baby was designed to have an in-built scooper for kids as she would not need all the space in the chest cavity but there you go.

Sister location was the year me and one of my close cousins spent so much time together so when we saw the sister location trailer we were hyped and waiting on the music videos and teasers. A few months later I think was when &quot;join us for a bite&quot; released and it was one of my favorites so this remake makes me so happy.<br><br>Edit: I forgot to include a few gripes soooo.....<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> I felt that there was something off with Baby&#39;s Shutting off animation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a> Balora&#39;s dance felt too fluid as it would make more sense for it to be more finicky like an animatronic. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m06s\">2:06</a> I felt that the Animatronics jaws didn&#39;t move enough and didn&#39;t hit as much as the originals. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> Same thing like Balora it felt too fluid and human like which crossed the uncanny valley for me but that doesn&#39;t mean I hate the fluidness entirely, some scenes look stunning like when the face-plates moved and this particular scene at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=2m47s\">2:47</a> which I very much like. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0HHAQAdnak&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> Idk but Baby&#39;s model is a bit off I think its that the head isn&#39;t lower down.<br><br>Overall the Music is an overall improvement, outstanding lighting that reminds me of &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, and TOP notch attention to detail!",

    "comment-24604": "Here is my overall musical analysis of the remaster of Join Us For A Bite, since I think it needs a comparison to the original 2016 version (please also bare in mind that THIS IS MY OPINION);<br><br>Pros:<br>- A lot more depth in the instrumental elements to the song <br>- Less compression/distortion in the drums and the bass<br>- Acoustic guitar strums are easier to hear<br>- Improved 3D sound<br>- The highs end sounds of the song feel more punchy and clear<br><br>Cons:<br>- A bit too much distortion and autotune in the voiceover (the 2016 version had this as well, though I believe it was at a lower amount of autotune, which helped it sink in with the song)<br>- The low end sounds don\u2019t feel as deep as they originally did in the 2016 version<br>-  Drums are probably a bit far on the high end of the sound of the songs<br>- Some of the synth instrumental notes/chords don\u2019t feel as drawn out (probably because they are either compressed or filtered)<br>- (Personal Recommendation) It would be interesting for the electric guitar appear more often in the instrumental<br><br>However, the visuals to the music video of the remaster are definitely an improvement and the production quality of the animation shows the evolution in the FNAF SFM\u2019s compared to the older animations between 2015-2018. So thumbs up the people that helped out with the animation. But also a thumbs up to the JT Music crew for giving one of the most essential ever created FNAF songs new life.",

She said &quot;-and Freddy told us your an organ donor.&quot; I remember asking her what she was singing, and she told me that I wouldn&#39;t know it; she told me, a bit afterwards, that it was a Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s song. I began to freak out, explaining to her that I LOVED FNAF. Ever since then, we&#39;ve been the best of friends. Whenever she moved out-of-state (I still talk to her, though it&#39;s not as often as I&#39;d like) I changed her ring-tone to Join Us For A Bite.<br><br>  The fact that this song was remastered, and that the remastered-version sounds awesome (with great animations) really does mean a lot to me.

In the original, it was Andrea&#39;s primary singing voice on top of a track running her voice but altered to be several octaves lower. It was subtle, but once you hear it you can&#39;t unhear it. I always kind of figured it was meant to be Freddy doing backup vocals LOL. In the new one, though, there&#39;s no lower register track-- it sounds like several versions of Andrea&#39;s normal voice.

I don&#39;t know if I can call it &quot;nostalgia&quot; like all these Gen Z and tiktoker comments are, but this really did make me realize just how long it&#39;s been. I remember how hyped I was about the release for this game, knowing it would be one of the first with actual in-game narrative, a stranger atmosphere, and more interactive puzzles. As much as I hate to admit it, my fursona seen in my PFP here was born from the FNAF era of furries as well, and I&#39;d be lying if I said this game didn&#39;t have any impact on my own creative works. Great to see how much Skull&#39;s musical talent has grown too, with so much new effects and mastering in this version of the song.",

I used to hate Fnaf mostly because I was a dumb six-year-old, who thought it was spooky. I remember my first introduction to Fnaf was actually a CookieSwirlC video. But I\u2019m pretty sure you were the first reason why I ever gave a chance at liking Fnaf, because it was this song. I had this song stuck in my head for weeks. I remember literally going downstairs on Christmas Eve to peek my presents, and realizing that I had this song stuck in my head, telling myself not to like it, because it\u2019s a Fnaf song, and I hate Fnaf, cuz it\u2019s scary. Then I watched a game theory video about Fnaf VR. It took me a couple more months after that but after that I was sold on the fandom and I joined. Thank you so much, JT. If you would never made join us for a bite in the first place, I would\u2019ve never been a part of this amazing fandom. And thank you all for reading through this.\u2764",

    "comment-26239": "Over the many years I&#39;ve watched this channel I&#39;ve seen it evolve into something that is a staple when you look into the nerdcore genre. The video mixed with the new mixing and Andrea&#39;s vocals still remaining true to the original video just adds a whole new layer of what &quot;Join Us For A Bite&quot; did for the brand. It doesn&#39;t even have Skull&#39;s vocals but it still feels so iconic for what Skull and Pat have both worked on over the years, Andrea just becoming like a staple unit in songs being released. Sometimes I&#39;ll load up a playlist with the original FNAF raps that Skull did for each game in the golden age of the channel. Thank you guys for making my childhood, and just to know you guys are based in North Carolina makes me even happier to have it be my home state. You guys have done so much for the nerdy kids in middle school who were able to bond over nerdcore.",

I&#39;ve got to be honest, I personally don&#39;t really think it needed one. The music arrangement was slightly changed and the SFM improved(the animatronics move their movable parts like the jaws to imitate singing slightly slower too?) to freshen it up I guess.<br><br>I still like it though, good work :)",

I have been around the game since the demo and I remember my cousin coming over, telling me about this &quot;scary horror Chuckie Cheese game&quot; that just released a demo, and we played it on their laptop. That same cousin got me into Undertale when its demo came out. Those years started so much for me. 2013 and 2014 were really something. I always kept up with the FNAF games, and when Sister Location came out in 2016, I found my absolute favorite in the series. This song, that game, this community. It all has done something amazing for me that I can never give back enough in return. This song, is my childhood. This song, brought me joy in a way that cannot be described. <br>You truly realize how much time has passed, when you look back at the dates.. the times. The memories you have feel timeless, and it&#39;s not until you look at the written date of some things, that you actually realize... That you are older. You have grown up. That this, has been beside you throughout that time. That those times where you would talk about one kid being an absolute master at gaming simply for beating FNAF&#39;s 5th or 6th nights, are in the past...<br><br>Thank you JT Music and friends...

    "comment-28824": "From what I understand from the complete tangent I had to take from the function call lessen...only the first four registers are used to pass arguments to a function.  If you need to pass more the four arguments you allocate 4-bytes for each additional argument on the stack and then in reverse order push the next arguments to the stack.  So if you want to have 7 arguments you&#39;d put arg0-3 into r0-3 and then allocate 3*4 bytes on the stack by subtracting 12 from the current sp.  Then push arg6, arg5, and arg4 onto the stack in that order. Then as you use them you pop [sp], [sp+4],[sp+8] which pops arg4, arg5, and lastly arg6 from the stack (last on first off).<br><br>and the result gets returned in r0?<br><br>How do I return more the one value?  I tried pushing additional values to the stack but on return I get an error if I try to pop values from the stack complaining that I have &quot;clobbered&quot; the stack???<br><br>My head HURTS!",
    "comment-28825": "@1:448:57 you say &quot;This is something you can do, but normally you do not&quot; &quot;this&quot; - meaning you can push return values from a function.   Well in my compiler this statement is not true.  You cannot push return values in the function and then pop them off in the calling routine.  I get you clobbered the sp in every version I tried over a 2-hour period so I am calling shenanigans!! on your claim - show me a working program - put 2 or more things on the stack before returning from the function and show me successfully popping them to different registers on returning. Do it and I will record my compiler puking if I try this.<br><br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfmRrPjnEw4&amp;t=1h48m21s\">1:48:21</a> This does not work for me... Here is what gets compiled<br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tpush {r2}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>but in the disassembly pop (r9,r0,r1} gets changed to pop{r0,r1,r9} by the compiler and I get an error saying function clobbered registers: sp because it has flipped the order of the items on the stack.<br><br>Looking at the memory it appears correct the order on the stack is {r9,r0,r1}.  The last item pushed is r9 followed by r0, r1 - which intuitively does not make sense because if you push r0 followed by r1 the order should be {r1,r0} on the stack then pushing r9 would make the stack {r9,r1,r0}, and the pop order would be pop{r9,r1,r0}.  The first thing on equals the last thing off and the last thing on equals the first thing off.  That is how a stack should work in my mind..<br><br>But I can accept the order of the push set being the same as the pop set so push{r0,r1} can be recovered with pop{r0,r1}.  But push{r9} should make the stack {r9,r0,r1} and replacing push{r9,10} would make the stack {r9,r10,r0,r1} so recovering the registers would be pop{r9,r10,r0,r1}?<br><br>My head wants to explode at this point.  Why is the compiler changing pop{r9,r0,r1} into pop{r0,r1,r9} then puking all over itself?<br><br>Thia clobbers the sp as well....<br><br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r10}\r<br>\tpop {r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tmov r3,#55\r<br>\tpush {r2,r3}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>So now my head totally exploded I just toss my hands up in the air and say your tutorial has succeeded in UNLEARNING me!!!!",

Is there a way to simply zero out all the registers before compiling and running a new program?",

    "comment-28828": "You need to be more accurate with your terminology. I&#39;ve just watched the beginning of the video and already you&#39;re using 3 terms incorrectly. Assembly language is <i>not</i> the place to play fast and loose with terms, they mean specific things and you should not misuse them. Your caseless misuse of these terms is damaging to those not familiar with them, and will only cause confusion later.<br><br>You claimed that &quot;word&quot; will change based on whether the CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit. This is <i>not the case</i> with ARM, where &quot;word&quot; always means a 32-bit value. Other ISAs differ, but in ARM it <i>always</i> means 32-bit.<br><br>You also said that opcode, instruction and mnemonic mean the same thing. They do not, they all have specific definitions that are decidedly not the same. The thing you type into your assembly file is a mnemonic. It&#39;s not an operation, instruction or opcode.<br><br>You also defined endianness completely wrong. The least <i>byte</i> is stored first, not <i>bit_. But you fumbled this by confusing the numeric representation in the register view where the _most</i> significant is on the left with the storage representation, where in little endian the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address.",

Mind is open and ready for learning... <br><br>I&#39;m going to make comments here as I go:<br><br>1) I disagree with your usage of the term Word. Usually a Word refers to 16bits, not 32. On a 680x0 a Word is 16bits a Longword is 32bits. On x86 a Word is 16bits a Doubleword is 33bits.<br><br>2) A register usually represents the architecture size. So on a 64bit architecture, the registers are 64bits wide, like rax on x64. On a 32bit architecture registers are 32bits wide, like say d0 on 680x0.<br><br>Now I&#39;m confused when you&#39;re talking about LDR and the stack. In my mind, the stack is something very specific. You can push values onto the stack and pull values off it, in a LIFO way. It also usually has a frame for function calls. This LDR instruction seems to have nothing to do with the stack, but rather an address of the data. It would be interesting to know if the addressing is PC relative or not, but I haven&#39;t finished watching yet.<br><br>Looks like the addressing IS PC relative, but I&#39;m struggling to understand the [pc, #-0] and how the comment says that it has a value of 8. At offset 8, there&#39;s an offset 16 to where the data is, but still don&#39;t see how an offset of 0 from the PC ends up pointing to 8!",

If I were to say from as much as I have learned. c++ is a very unique language actually the only language I see that is used in a very specific way because c++ is additions as opposed to a direct evolution making it more weird and backwards compatible with c. most hate c++ has is for what specifically c++ is and honestly c++ has a very specific use and it seems to me that is to code things closer to the base, but also being able to pull from function libraries to speed up development time within the languages level.

    "comment-28913": "You are a very good teacher. Thank you for this content. One question though? It seems like you consistently refer to  the general memory as the stack. The stack is a very specific region of memory that is associated with the stack pointer and the related push/pop commands. The stack is held in general purpose memory but general purpose memory itself is not the stack. What am I missing?",

Imagine have two binary numbers x&gt;y with 4 digits. To subtract y from x we can sum x+(16-y) and take 16 by ignoring the first digit of the 5 digit sum. The number 16-y is called the two&#39;s compliment of y.  Equivalently, if we invert all the digits of y, resulting in the number z, we have y+z = (1111) = 15 and  z + 1 = 16-x. Therefore, to get the two compliment we can just invert the digits and sum 1.",

The later PUSH and POP of R2 supports my suspicion; although the disassembly shows R0 and R1 still got their original values back.    Is there a hidden detail? (such as popping acts in the reverse order, and pushing acts in the direct order; like PUSH {R0, R1} ==&gt; first pushes R0, then pushes R1;     and  POP {R0, R1}==&gt;first pops R1, then pops R0.

    "comment-28986": "Sorry to point out this, but you are confusing viewers with such interpretation of Little endian and Big endian. First, note that regardless of processor endian-ness, the number in a multi-byte register will always be represented with most significant figure to the left (the way we write numbers on paper). The only difference will be in that which byte is at which address within address range of the register, and that would be important only if we iterate over bytes one at a time (e.g. sending an array of them to a character device in correct order).<br>It is Big endian if the most significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register (the way we usually write and read numbers).<br>It is Little endian if least significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register.<br><br>Apparently, Big endian arrangement comes &quot;naturally&quot; from our historical representation of Arab (Indian) numeral numbers, but Little endian is arrangement which had unique advantage: it enabled much cleaner (a single, simpler iterative loop) multi-word arithmetics (addition and subtraction), especially if the numbers were of different lengths (so we would start e.g. adding them  lower parts first, and if there was a carry, we would take it into account in next iteration with higher numeral positions).",

    "comment-29077": "For business and other commercial applications, little endian hardware arrangements can be a booby trap, especially with old higher-level languages, such as old COBOL compilers and Fortran, as if one storage areas use the &quot;redefine&quot; construct in whicy a character array has a word array alternate construct, a program that was written for use on IBM or Prime computers, both of which are big endian in structure, and is ported to a Digital equipment machine, which is little endian in design, the program behavior is likely to be erroneous in it operation. With newer COBOL language versions, which have been enhances to provided needed alphanumeric data manipulations constructs, the use of redefines using different datatypes is no longer needed. Little endian architecture provided interesting hardware design shortcuts have no place in modern application design! The could be a reason that Prime computer architecture was more successful in business companies than Digital Euipment products.",

    "comment-29380": "Unless your tied into Assembly through either C or C ++, most language development will fail. Why? <br><br>For starters the underlying Unix or  Mimicked Unix base is already tied into the file system, the graphics windowing system either x19 or win32 and utilizes the cut, copy and paste utilities. <br><br>All programing in Assembly will not advance anything the C languages have already taken over forty plus years to test, implant and make useful for all languages. So unless your doing Assembly as a hobby, would be your thing. Otherwise it&#39;s a lost cause. <br><br>Also languages such as CPython and Rust are both C and C++ respectfully are the exception to that rule. And just imagine, both are an already compiled language processing loop long before their token streams are processed. Rust uses the backdoor of the GCC Compiler which makes it C based and needs no conversion to Assembly whatsoever. Imagine that, a token stream being read into a loop, processed then executed by an already compiled language which requires no assembly because it&#39;s running in Machine Binary.",

    "comment-29518": "From what I understand from the complete tangent I had to take from the function call lessen...only the first four registers are used to pass arguments to a function.  If you need to pass more the four arguments you allocate 4-bytes for each additional argument on the stack and then in reverse order push the next arguments to the stack.  So if you want to have 7 arguments you&#39;d put arg0-3 into r0-3 and then allocate 3*4 bytes on the stack by subtracting 12 from the current sp.  Then push arg6, arg5, and arg4 onto the stack in that order. Then as you use them you pop [sp], [sp+4],[sp+8] which pops arg4, arg5, and lastly arg6 from the stack (last on first off).<br><br>and the result gets returned in r0?<br><br>How do I return more the one value?  I tried pushing additional values to the stack but on return I get an error if I try to pop values from the stack complaining that I have &quot;clobbered&quot; the stack???<br><br>My head HURTS!",
    "comment-29519": "@1:448:57 you say &quot;This is something you can do, but normally you do not&quot; &quot;this&quot; - meaning you can push return values from a function.   Well in my compiler this statement is not true.  You cannot push return values in the function and then pop them off in the calling routine.  I get you clobbered the sp in every version I tried over a 2-hour period so I am calling shenanigans!! on your claim - show me a working program - put 2 or more things on the stack before returning from the function and show me successfully popping them to different registers on returning. Do it and I will record my compiler puking if I try this.<br><br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfmRrPjnEw4&amp;t=1h48m21s\">1:48:21</a> This does not work for me... Here is what gets compiled<br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tpush {r2}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>but in the disassembly pop (r9,r0,r1} gets changed to pop{r0,r1,r9} by the compiler and I get an error saying function clobbered registers: sp because it has flipped the order of the items on the stack.<br><br>Looking at the memory it appears correct the order on the stack is {r9,r0,r1}.  The last item pushed is r9 followed by r0, r1 - which intuitively does not make sense because if you push r0 followed by r1 the order should be {r1,r0} on the stack then pushing r9 would make the stack {r9,r1,r0}, and the pop order would be pop{r9,r1,r0}.  The first thing on equals the last thing off and the last thing on equals the first thing off.  That is how a stack should work in my mind..<br><br>But I can accept the order of the push set being the same as the pop set so push{r0,r1} can be recovered with pop{r0,r1}.  But push{r9} should make the stack {r9,r0,r1} and replacing push{r9,10} would make the stack {r9,r10,r0,r1} so recovering the registers would be pop{r9,r10,r0,r1}?<br><br>My head wants to explode at this point.  Why is the compiler changing pop{r9,r0,r1} into pop{r0,r1,r9} then puking all over itself?<br><br>Thia clobbers the sp as well....<br><br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r10}\r<br>\tpop {r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tmov r3,#55\r<br>\tpush {r2,r3}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>So now my head totally exploded I just toss my hands up in the air and say your tutorial has succeeded in UNLEARNING me!!!!",
    "comment-29520": "many of your examples assume the results register is 0.  However, when following the examples results from previous examples will remain in all the registers.  The only way I know to get around this is simply to zero the results register at the top of the program or zero all 13 registers with thirteen mov rx,#0 commands.  Is there a way to simply zero out all the registers before compiling and running a new program?",

    "comment-29522": "You need to be more accurate with your terminology. I&#39;ve just watched the beginning of the video and already you&#39;re using 3 terms incorrectly. Assembly language is <i>not</i> the place to play fast and loose with terms, they mean specific things and you should not misuse them. Your caseless misuse of these terms is damaging to those not familiar with them, and will only cause confusion later.<br><br>You claimed that &quot;word&quot; will change based on whether the CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit. This is <i>not the case</i> with ARM, where &quot;word&quot; always means a 32-bit value. Other ISAs differ, but in ARM it <i>always</i> means 32-bit.<br><br>You also said that opcode, instruction and mnemonic mean the same thing. They do not, they all have specific definitions that are decidedly not the same. The thing you type into your assembly file is a mnemonic. It&#39;s not an operation, instruction or opcode.<br><br>You also defined endianness completely wrong. The least <i>byte</i> is stored first, not <i>bit_. But you fumbled this by confusing the numeric representation in the register view where the _most</i> significant is on the left with the storage representation, where in little endian the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address.",

Mind is open and ready for learning... <br><br>I&#39;m going to make comments here as I go:<br><br>1) I disagree with your usage of the term Word. Usually a Word refers to 16bits, not 32. On a 680x0 a Word is 16bits a Longword is 32bits. On x86 a Word is 16bits a Doubleword is 33bits.<br><br>2) A register usually represents the architecture size. So on a 64bit architecture, the registers are 64bits wide, like rax on x64. On a 32bit architecture registers are 32bits wide, like say d0 on 680x0.<br><br>Now I&#39;m confused when you&#39;re talking about LDR and the stack. In my mind, the stack is something very specific. You can push values onto the stack and pull values off it, in a LIFO way. It also usually has a frame for function calls. This LDR instruction seems to have nothing to do with the stack, but rather an address of the data. It would be interesting to know if the addressing is PC relative or not, but I haven&#39;t finished watching yet.<br><br>Looks like the addressing IS PC relative, but I&#39;m struggling to understand the [pc, #-0] and how the comment says that it has a value of 8. At offset 8, there&#39;s an offset 16 to where the data is, but still don&#39;t see how an offset of 0 from the PC ends up pointing to 8!",

A hex digit represents 4 bits.<br>hex F = decimal 15 = binary 1111<br><br>2. Two hex digits represent an octet (a byte, 8 bits).<br>hex FF = decimal 255 = binary 1111 1111<br><br>3.

    "comment-29599": "Odd thing I looked at machine code, and figured out I need just as much direction as a machine needs. so I think like the machine. so, I have found binary incredibly easy for me, and higher languages harder. So I&#39;m trying to fill that gap by working my way up to understand what is happening in the background. If I were to say from as much as I have learned. c++ is a very unique language actually the only language I see that is used in a very specific way because c++ is additions as opposed to a direct evolution making it more weird and backwards compatible with c. most hate c++ has is for what specifically c++ is and honestly c++ has a very specific use and it seems to me that is to code things closer to the base, but also being able to pull from function libraries to speed up development time within the languages level. Hence, since I understand binary more, I&#39;m going to work my way up from binary-&gt;assembly-&gt;C-&gt; C++ so I can get more familiar and more fluent in reading code.",

Imagine have two binary numbers x&gt;y with 4 digits. To subtract y from x we can sum x+(16-y) and take 16 by ignoring the first digit of the 5 digit sum. The number 16-y is called the two&#39;s compliment of y.  Equivalently, if we invert all the digits of y, resulting in the number z, we have y+z = (1111) = 15 and  z + 1 = 16-x. Therefore, to get the two compliment we can just invert the digits and sum 1.",

The later PUSH and POP of R2 supports my suspicion; although the disassembly shows R0 and R1 still got their original values back.    Is there a hidden detail? (such as popping acts in the reverse order, and pushing acts in the direct order; like PUSH {R0, R1} ==&gt; first pushes R0, then pushes R1;     and  POP {R0, R1}==&gt;first pops R1, then pops R0.

    "comment-29680": "Sorry to point out this, but you are confusing viewers with such interpretation of Little endian and Big endian. First, note that regardless of processor endian-ness, the number in a multi-byte register will always be represented with most significant figure to the left (the way we write numbers on paper). The only difference will be in that which byte is at which address within address range of the register, and that would be important only if we iterate over bytes one at a time (e.g. sending an array of them to a character device in correct order).<br>It is Big endian if the most significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register (the way we usually write and read numbers).<br>It is Little endian if least significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register.<br><br>Apparently, Big endian arrangement comes &quot;naturally&quot; from our historical representation of Arab (Indian) numeral numbers, but Little endian is arrangement which had unique advantage: it enabled much cleaner (a single, simpler iterative loop) multi-word arithmetics (addition and subtraction), especially if the numbers were of different lengths (so we would start e.g. adding them  lower parts first, and if there was a carry, we would take it into account in next iteration with higher numeral positions).",

With newer COBOL language versions, which have been enhances to provided needed alphanumeric data manipulations constructs, the use of redefines using different datatypes is no longer needed. Little endian architecture provided interesting hardware design shortcuts have no place in modern application design! The could be a reason that Prime computer architecture was more successful in business companies than Digital Euipment products.",

    "comment-30074": "Unless your tied into Assembly through either C or C ++, most language development will fail. Why? <br><br>For starters the underlying Unix or  Mimicked Unix base is already tied into the file system, the graphics windowing system either x19 or win32 and utilizes the cut, copy and paste utilities. <br><br>All programing in Assembly will not advance anything the C languages have already taken over forty plus years to test, implant and make useful for all languages. So unless your doing Assembly as a hobby, would be your thing. Otherwise it&#39;s a lost cause. <br><br>Also languages such as CPython and Rust are both C and C++ respectfully are the exception to that rule. And just imagine, both are an already compiled language processing loop long before their token streams are processed. Rust uses the backdoor of the GCC Compiler which makes it C based and needs no conversion to Assembly whatsoever. Imagine that, a token stream being read into a loop, processed then executed by an already compiled language which requires no assembly because it&#39;s running in Machine Binary.",

Here is the modified version that works: <br><br>global _start<br>_start:<br>        MOV X0,#1<br>        LDR X1, =message<br>        LDR X2, =len<br>        MOV W8, #64<br>        SVC #0<br><br>        MOV X0, #0<br>        MOV W8, #93<br>        SVC #0<br><br>.data<br>message:<br>        .asciz &quot;Hello World\\n&quot;<br>len = .-message",

    "comment-30212": "From what I understand from the complete tangent I had to take from the function call lessen...only the first four registers are used to pass arguments to a function.  If you need to pass more the four arguments you allocate 4-bytes for each additional argument on the stack and then in reverse order push the next arguments to the stack.  So if you want to have 7 arguments you&#39;d put arg0-3 into r0-3 and then allocate 3*4 bytes on the stack by subtracting 12 from the current sp.  Then push arg6, arg5, and arg4 onto the stack in that order. Then as you use them you pop [sp], [sp+4],[sp+8] which pops arg4, arg5, and lastly arg6 from the stack (last on first off).<br><br>and the result gets returned in r0?<br><br>How do I return more the one value?  I tried pushing additional values to the stack but on return I get an error if I try to pop values from the stack complaining that I have &quot;clobbered&quot; the stack???<br><br>My head HURTS!",
    "comment-30213": "@1:448:57 you say &quot;This is something you can do, but normally you do not&quot; &quot;this&quot; - meaning you can push return values from a function.   Well in my compiler this statement is not true.  You cannot push return values in the function and then pop them off in the calling routine.  I get you clobbered the sp in every version I tried over a 2-hour period so I am calling shenanigans!! on your claim - show me a working program - put 2 or more things on the stack before returning from the function and show me successfully popping them to different registers on returning. Do it and I will record my compiler puking if I try this.<br><br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfmRrPjnEw4&amp;t=1h48m21s\">1:48:21</a> This does not work for me... Here is what gets compiled<br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tpush {r2}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>but in the disassembly pop (r9,r0,r1} gets changed to pop{r0,r1,r9} by the compiler and I get an error saying function clobbered registers: sp because it has flipped the order of the items on the stack.<br><br>Looking at the memory it appears correct the order on the stack is {r9,r0,r1}.  The last item pushed is r9 followed by r0, r1 - which intuitively does not make sense because if you push r0 followed by r1 the order should be {r1,r0} on the stack then pushing r9 would make the stack {r9,r1,r0}, and the pop order would be pop{r9,r1,r0}.  The first thing on equals the last thing off and the last thing on equals the first thing off.  That is how a stack should work in my mind..<br><br>But I can accept the order of the push set being the same as the pop set so push{r0,r1} can be recovered with pop{r0,r1}.  But push{r9} should make the stack {r9,r0,r1} and replacing push{r9,10} would make the stack {r9,r10,r0,r1} so recovering the registers would be pop{r9,r10,r0,r1}?<br><br>My head wants to explode at this point.  Why is the compiler changing pop{r9,r0,r1} into pop{r0,r1,r9} then puking all over itself?<br><br>Thia clobbers the sp as well....<br><br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r10}\r<br>\tpop {r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tmov r3,#55\r<br>\tpush {r2,r3}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>So now my head totally exploded I just toss my hands up in the air and say your tutorial has succeeded in UNLEARNING me!!!!",

    "comment-30216": "You need to be more accurate with your terminology. I&#39;ve just watched the beginning of the video and already you&#39;re using 3 terms incorrectly. Assembly language is <i>not</i> the place to play fast and loose with terms, they mean specific things and you should not misuse them. Your caseless misuse of these terms is damaging to those not familiar with them, and will only cause confusion later.<br><br>You claimed that &quot;word&quot; will change based on whether the CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit. This is <i>not the case</i> with ARM, where &quot;word&quot; always means a 32-bit value. Other ISAs differ, but in ARM it <i>always</i> means 32-bit.<br><br>You also said that opcode, instruction and mnemonic mean the same thing. They do not, they all have specific definitions that are decidedly not the same. The thing you type into your assembly file is a mnemonic. It&#39;s not an operation, instruction or opcode.<br><br>You also defined endianness completely wrong. The least <i>byte</i> is stored first, not <i>bit_. But you fumbled this by confusing the numeric representation in the register view where the _most</i> significant is on the left with the storage representation, where in little endian the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address.",

Mind is open and ready for learning... <br><br>I&#39;m going to make comments here as I go:<br><br>1) I disagree with your usage of the term Word. Usually a Word refers to 16bits, not 32. On a 680x0 a Word is 16bits a Longword is 32bits. On x86 a Word is 16bits a Doubleword is 33bits.<br><br>2) A register usually represents the architecture size. So on a 64bit architecture, the registers are 64bits wide, like rax on x64. On a 32bit architecture registers are 32bits wide, like say d0 on 680x0.<br><br>Now I&#39;m confused when you&#39;re talking about LDR and the stack. In my mind, the stack is something very specific. You can push values onto the stack and pull values off it, in a LIFO way. It also usually has a frame for function calls. This LDR instruction seems to have nothing to do with the stack, but rather an address of the data. It would be interesting to know if the addressing is PC relative or not, but I haven&#39;t finished watching yet.<br><br>Looks like the addressing IS PC relative, but I&#39;m struggling to understand the [pc, #-0] and how the comment says that it has a value of 8. At offset 8, there&#39;s an offset 16 to where the data is, but still don&#39;t see how an offset of 0 from the PC ends up pointing to 8!",

So I&#39;m trying to fill that gap by working my way up to understand what is happening in the background. If I were to say from as much as I have learned. c++ is a very unique language actually the only language I see that is used in a very specific way because c++ is additions as opposed to a direct evolution making it more weird and backwards compatible with c. most hate c++ has is for what specifically c++ is and honestly c++ has a very specific use and it seems to me that is to code things closer to the base, but also being able to pull from function libraries to speed up development time within the languages level. Hence, since I understand binary more, I&#39;m going to work my way up from binary-&gt;assembly-&gt;C-&gt; C++ so I can get more familiar and more fluent in reading code.",

Imagine have two binary numbers x&gt;y with 4 digits. To subtract y from x we can sum x+(16-y) and take 16 by ignoring the first digit of the 5 digit sum. The number 16-y is called the two&#39;s compliment of y.  Equivalently, if we invert all the digits of y, resulting in the number z, we have y+z = (1111) = 15 and  z + 1 = 16-x. Therefore, to get the two compliment we can just invert the digits and sum 1.",

    "comment-30374": "Sorry to point out this, but you are confusing viewers with such interpretation of Little endian and Big endian. First, note that regardless of processor endian-ness, the number in a multi-byte register will always be represented with most significant figure to the left (the way we write numbers on paper). The only difference will be in that which byte is at which address within address range of the register, and that would be important only if we iterate over bytes one at a time (e.g. sending an array of them to a character device in correct order).<br>It is Big endian if the most significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register (the way we usually write and read numbers).<br>It is Little endian if least significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register.<br><br>Apparently, Big endian arrangement comes &quot;naturally&quot; from our historical representation of Arab (Indian) numeral numbers, but Little endian is arrangement which had unique advantage: it enabled much cleaner (a single, simpler iterative loop) multi-word arithmetics (addition and subtraction), especially if the numbers were of different lengths (so we would start e.g. adding them  lower parts first, and if there was a carry, we would take it into account in next iteration with higher numeral positions).",

With newer COBOL language versions, which have been enhances to provided needed alphanumeric data manipulations constructs, the use of redefines using different datatypes is no longer needed. Little endian architecture provided interesting hardware design shortcuts have no place in modern application design!

    "comment-30768": "Unless your tied into Assembly through either C or C ++, most language development will fail. Why? <br><br>For starters the underlying Unix or  Mimicked Unix base is already tied into the file system, the graphics windowing system either x19 or win32 and utilizes the cut, copy and paste utilities. <br><br>All programing in Assembly will not advance anything the C languages have already taken over forty plus years to test, implant and make useful for all languages. So unless your doing Assembly as a hobby, would be your thing. Otherwise it&#39;s a lost cause. <br><br>Also languages such as CPython and Rust are both C and C++ respectfully are the exception to that rule. And just imagine, both are an already compiled language processing loop long before their token streams are processed. Rust uses the backdoor of the GCC Compiler which makes it C based and needs no conversion to Assembly whatsoever. Imagine that, a token stream being read into a loop, processed then executed by an already compiled language which requires no assembly because it&#39;s running in Machine Binary.",

    "comment-30906": "From what I understand from the complete tangent I had to take from the function call lessen...only the first four registers are used to pass arguments to a function.  If you need to pass more the four arguments you allocate 4-bytes for each additional argument on the stack and then in reverse order push the next arguments to the stack.  So if you want to have 7 arguments you&#39;d put arg0-3 into r0-3 and then allocate 3*4 bytes on the stack by subtracting 12 from the current sp.  Then push arg6, arg5, and arg4 onto the stack in that order. Then as you use them you pop [sp], [sp+4],[sp+8] which pops arg4, arg5, and lastly arg6 from the stack (last on first off).<br><br>and the result gets returned in r0?<br><br>How do I return more the one value?  I tried pushing additional values to the stack but on return I get an error if I try to pop values from the stack complaining that I have &quot;clobbered&quot; the stack???<br><br>My head HURTS!",
    "comment-30907": "@1:448:57 you say &quot;This is something you can do, but normally you do not&quot; &quot;this&quot; - meaning you can push return values from a function.   Well in my compiler this statement is not true.  You cannot push return values in the function and then pop them off in the calling routine.  I get you clobbered the sp in every version I tried over a 2-hour period so I am calling shenanigans!! on your claim - show me a working program - put 2 or more things on the stack before returning from the function and show me successfully popping them to different registers on returning. Do it and I will record my compiler puking if I try this.<br><br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfmRrPjnEw4&amp;t=1h48m21s\">1:48:21</a> This does not work for me... Here is what gets compiled<br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tpush {r2}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>but in the disassembly pop (r9,r0,r1} gets changed to pop{r0,r1,r9} by the compiler and I get an error saying function clobbered registers: sp because it has flipped the order of the items on the stack.<br><br>Looking at the memory it appears correct the order on the stack is {r9,r0,r1}.  The last item pushed is r9 followed by r0, r1 - which intuitively does not make sense because if you push r0 followed by r1 the order should be {r1,r0} on the stack then pushing r9 would make the stack {r9,r1,r0}, and the pop order would be pop{r9,r1,r0}.  The first thing on equals the last thing off and the last thing on equals the first thing off.  That is how a stack should work in my mind..<br><br>But I can accept the order of the push set being the same as the pop set so push{r0,r1} can be recovered with pop{r0,r1}.  But push{r9} should make the stack {r9,r0,r1} and replacing push{r9,10} would make the stack {r9,r10,r0,r1} so recovering the registers would be pop{r9,r10,r0,r1}?<br><br>My head wants to explode at this point.  Why is the compiler changing pop{r9,r0,r1} into pop{r0,r1,r9} then puking all over itself?<br><br>Thia clobbers the sp as well....<br><br>.global _start\r<br>_start:\r<br>\t\r<br>\tmov r0,#1\r<br>\tmov r1,#3\r<br>\tpush {r0,r1}\r<br>\tbl get_value\r<br>\tpop {r9,r10}\r<br>\tpop {r0,r1}\r<br>\tb exit\r<br>\t\r<br>get_value:\r<br>\tmov r0,#5\r<br>\tmov r1,#7\r<br>\tadd r2,r0,r1\r<br>\tmov r3,#55\r<br>\tpush {r2,r3}\r<br>\tbx lr\r<br>\t\r<br>\t\r<br>exit:<br><br>So now my head totally exploded I just toss my hands up in the air and say your tutorial has succeeded in UNLEARNING me!!!!",

    "comment-30910": "You need to be more accurate with your terminology. I&#39;ve just watched the beginning of the video and already you&#39;re using 3 terms incorrectly. Assembly language is <i>not</i> the place to play fast and loose with terms, they mean specific things and you should not misuse them. Your caseless misuse of these terms is damaging to those not familiar with them, and will only cause confusion later.<br><br>You claimed that &quot;word&quot; will change based on whether the CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit. This is <i>not the case</i> with ARM, where &quot;word&quot; always means a 32-bit value. Other ISAs differ, but in ARM it <i>always</i> means 32-bit.<br><br>You also said that opcode, instruction and mnemonic mean the same thing. They do not, they all have specific definitions that are decidedly not the same. The thing you type into your assembly file is a mnemonic. It&#39;s not an operation, instruction or opcode.<br><br>You also defined endianness completely wrong. The least <i>byte</i> is stored first, not <i>bit_. But you fumbled this by confusing the numeric representation in the register view where the _most</i> significant is on the left with the storage representation, where in little endian the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address.",

Mind is open and ready for learning... <br><br>I&#39;m going to make comments here as I go:<br><br>1) I disagree with your usage of the term Word. Usually a Word refers to 16bits, not 32. On a 680x0 a Word is 16bits a Longword is 32bits. On x86 a Word is 16bits a Doubleword is 33bits.<br><br>2) A register usually represents the architecture size. So on a 64bit architecture, the registers are 64bits wide, like rax on x64. On a 32bit architecture registers are 32bits wide, like say d0 on 680x0.<br><br>Now I&#39;m confused when you&#39;re talking about LDR and the stack. In my mind, the stack is something very specific. You can push values onto the stack and pull values off it, in a LIFO way. It also usually has a frame for function calls. This LDR instruction seems to have nothing to do with the stack, but rather an address of the data. It would be interesting to know if the addressing is PC relative or not, but I haven&#39;t finished watching yet.<br><br>Looks like the addressing IS PC relative, but I&#39;m struggling to understand the [pc, #-0] and how the comment says that it has a value of 8. At offset 8, there&#39;s an offset 16 to where the data is, but still don&#39;t see how an offset of 0 from the PC ends up pointing to 8!",

As he explains at the beginning, that&#39;s not a ten, it&#39;s a sixteen, because the numbers are hexadecimal (but it is still correct that if you add an offset of 4, you get the memory location of the next element).<br><br>A minimal refresher for whoever needs it:<br><br>1. A hex digit represents 4 bits.<br>hex F = decimal 15 = binary 1111<br><br>2. Two hex digits represent an octet (a byte, 8 bits).<br>hex FF = decimal 255 = binary 1111 1111<br><br>3.

So I&#39;m trying to fill that gap by working my way up to understand what is happening in the background. If I were to say from as much as I have learned. c++ is a very unique language actually the only language I see that is used in a very specific way because c++ is additions as opposed to a direct evolution making it more weird and backwards compatible with c. most hate c++ has is for what specifically c++ is and honestly c++ has a very specific use and it seems to me that is to code things closer to the base, but also being able to pull from function libraries to speed up development time within the languages level. Hence, since I understand binary more, I&#39;m going to work my way up from binary-&gt;assembly-&gt;C-&gt; C++ so I can get more familiar and more fluent in reading code.",

Imagine have two binary numbers x&gt;y with 4 digits. To subtract y from x we can sum x+(16-y) and take 16 by ignoring the first digit of the 5 digit sum. The number 16-y is called the two&#39;s compliment of y.  Equivalently, if we invert all the digits of y, resulting in the number z, we have y+z = (1111) = 15 and  z + 1 = 16-x. Therefore, to get the two compliment we can just invert the digits and sum 1.",

    "comment-31068": "Sorry to point out this, but you are confusing viewers with such interpretation of Little endian and Big endian. First, note that regardless of processor endian-ness, the number in a multi-byte register will always be represented with most significant figure to the left (the way we write numbers on paper). The only difference will be in that which byte is at which address within address range of the register, and that would be important only if we iterate over bytes one at a time (e.g. sending an array of them to a character device in correct order).<br>It is Big endian if the most significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register (the way we usually write and read numbers).<br>It is Little endian if least significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register.<br><br>Apparently, Big endian arrangement comes &quot;naturally&quot; from our historical representation of Arab (Indian) numeral numbers, but Little endian is arrangement which had unique advantage: it enabled much cleaner (a single, simpler iterative loop) multi-word arithmetics (addition and subtraction), especially if the numbers were of different lengths (so we would start e.g. adding them  lower parts first, and if there was a carry, we would take it into account in next iteration with higher numeral positions).",

The &quot;stack&quot; name refers to an area of memory with very specific rules of access and usage.<br>- With an AND operation it might be really interesting to have the &quot;Z&quot;ero flag set by &quot;ANDS&quot;.

With newer COBOL language versions, which have been enhances to provided needed alphanumeric data manipulations constructs, the use of redefines using different datatypes is no longer needed.

    "comment-31462": "Unless your tied into Assembly through either C or C ++, most language development will fail. Why? <br><br>For starters the underlying Unix or  Mimicked Unix base is already tied into the file system, the graphics windowing system either x19 or win32 and utilizes the cut, copy and paste utilities. <br><br>All programing in Assembly will not advance anything the C languages have already taken over forty plus years to test, implant and make useful for all languages. So unless your doing Assembly as a hobby, would be your thing. Otherwise it&#39;s a lost cause. <br><br>Also languages such as CPython and Rust are both C and C++ respectfully are the exception to that rule. And just imagine, both are an already compiled language processing loop long before their token streams are processed. Rust uses the backdoor of the GCC Compiler which makes it C based and needs no conversion to Assembly whatsoever. Imagine that, a token stream being read into a loop, processed then executed by an already compiled language which requires no assembly because it&#39;s running in Machine Binary.",
