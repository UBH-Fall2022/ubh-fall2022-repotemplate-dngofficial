    "comment-11": "This was an amazing video to sit down and watch being a beginner learner into coding myself. Watching this whole video gave me a lot tips on how to tackle problems and how to go through it step by step to get a better understanding of the question given. By questioning/answering edge cases and giving examples of what you want the program to actually run/spit out. I, myself, never really went through this process and just went straight into the coding aspect and try work my way through that which made it really hard on me, decreasing my confidence. <br>I give huge props to Eli because he came into this mock interview not prepared at all. You can tell Eli was nervous by the way he laughs and how he moving around a lot and wasn&#39;t really still at first. But after seeing you giving him the guidance and patiently talking to him through the process, Eli became more a lot confident and was able to work solving the code faster by understanding it. <br>The first coding problem was was done beautifully and I was able to understand it every step of the way. But the second coding question became a lot hard to follow due to the second if statement and understanding where to put each variable within the various brackets. My brain would always explode when I see more than 20 lines of code and would constantly have to run myself through the code repeatedly to understand it again. <br>Also, I really enjoyed on how Nader kept a calm/cheerful mood when talking to Eli even after seeing his nervousness when working through the problems by giving him reassurance on how he can approach things whenever Eli was stuck. I feel like I, myself, would have a better understanding If I had someone I can talk to and ask a lot of questions if I ever get stuck on how to approach things or ask how certain code works.",

No one is going to write a script to fix div tags in an html doc, instead they would just use find and replace. Also both questions were about iterating over strings.  For the 2nd solution, the most efficient choice would be to write a regex do identify every other div tag and use replaceAll, I know that&#39;s what I&#39;d do with emacs (though wouldn&#39;t need the regex to ignore the first div tag in a text editor.).",

Watching this whole video gave me a lot tips on how to tackle problems and how to go through it step by step to get a better understanding of the question given. By questioning/answering edge cases and giving examples of what you want the program to actually run/spit out. I, myself, never really went through this process and just went straight into the coding aspect and try work my way through that which made it really hard on me, decreasing my confidence. <br>I give huge props to Eli because he came into this mock interview not prepared at all. You can tell Eli was nervous by the way he laughs and how he moving around a lot and wasn&#39;t really still at first. But after seeing you giving him the guidance and patiently talking to him through the process, Eli became more a lot confident and was able to work solving the code faster by understanding it. <br>The first coding problem was was done beautifully and I was able to understand it every step of the way. But the second coding question became a lot hard to follow due to the second if statement and understanding where to put each variable within the various brackets. My brain would always explode when I see more than 20 lines of code and would constantly have to run myself through the code repeatedly to understand it again. <br>Also, I really enjoyed on how Nader kept a calm/cheerful mood when talking to Eli even after seeing his nervousness when working through the problems by giving him reassurance on how he can approach things whenever Eli was stuck. I feel like I, myself, would have a better understanding If I had someone I can talk to and ask a lot of questions if I ever get stuck on how to approach things or ask how certain code works.",

Am a full stack team lead and we don&#39;t use JavaScript at my company fortunately.  The one minor criticism that I have is that the problems should be more realistic and also add more variety.  No one is going to write a script to fix div tags in an html doc, instead they would just use find and replace. Also both questions were about iterating over strings.  For the 2nd solution, the most efficient choice would be to write a regex do identify every other div tag and use replaceAll, I know that&#39;s what I&#39;d do with emacs (though wouldn&#39;t need the regex to ignore the first div tag in a text editor.).",

I am really impressed by your learning methodology. I have learned a lot from you in both of these stuffs of HTML and CSS. I am about to complete many of the doubts in HTML tags. I listened every point very clearly. Now, trying to stick around to learn CSS later. Keep up a great work like that.

I even deleted the html and css and recreated it word for word like yours.... I just dont get it. There is nothing else I can do if my code already is identical... I checked all tags and all names - everything seems perfectly fine besides the fact that I dont see any of these boxes. I can give the boxes some text and even see the text at the right place, but no background color - its all the color of the container. And when you start to move a box to the bottom left - this doesnt work either. I gave the box text and it didnt move at all for me ...

Does that mean anything at all?",
    "comment-919": "I like your tutorial, but for me you are often a little to fast. I try to do the same thing you do at the same time, but thats not possible most of the time, cause you are talking to fast and wrinting code even faster. Additionaly its hard to keep up, cause you often start with a new blank code base, but for me as a beginner would love to have all I learned inside one &quot;program&quot;. Would have also been great if you could talk about creating comments right at the beginning, cause that helps a lot with understanding the code later on. Also you are often changing code, but thats nothing I can do cause I need examples for everything in my code and comment them to understand them when I look at them later on. Due to that its even harder to follow.",

    "comment-1154": "Hi, just out of curiosity... Why should anyone learn HTML CSS, specially when you can create a beautiful website using only WordPress? With the &quot;Elementor Pro&quot; it&#39;s so easy to design a beautiful website. I mean I don&#39;t want provoke anybody. I just want to know why? Also in Fiverr, there&#39;s a lot of work for WordPress developers whereas I don&#39;t see many people asking for static HTML CSS developer. It makes sense because the clients wouldn&#39;t just want to be left off with a design that he cannot change. I mean with static HTML CSS, if a client isn&#39;t familiar with it, even to change a simple image, he&#39;d have to hire somebody. But with WordPress, he can do it himself. It&#39;s very easy for the clients to manage a WordPress and because it has a good demand, WordPress developers can make more money whereas static HTML CSS developers can&#39;t. So why should people invest his time into learning HTML CSS which doesn&#39;t guarantee his income?",

Finding the optimal solution is a must, but they\u2019re also deciding if they want to work with you.  Some crude banter can give the wrong signal, and there\u2019s zero advantage to you in risking it.  Be polite.  Don\u2019t be cocky.  Every grading rubric has score around cultural and team fit.  Just FYI.",
