And after thr flight stopped, neither the old man - Nigale and the captain discussed about the fact they both were really really thinking about this. If you know what I meant. I don&#39;t understand this logic. Both pretended as of they don&#39;t know",

Also the modern boeing is quite faster then those messersmidts, about a 200 km/h probably. A modern passenger airplan has a pressurized hull so it could just clime to a higher altitude where the fighters would not be able to go.",
